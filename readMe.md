# FastAPI vs Django vs Flask

## FastAPI
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and to provide high performance. FastAPI is built on Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts.

### Advantages:
- **Performance**: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python web frameworks.
- **Ease of Use**: Automatic interactive API documentation.
- **Type Safety**: Uses Python type hints for data validation and serialization.

## Django
Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is known for its "batteries-included" philosophy, providing a lot of built-in features.

### Advantages:
- **Full-Featured**: Comes with an ORM, authentication, and admin interface.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for large-scale applications.
- **Community**: Large and active community with extensive documentation.

## Flask
Flask is a micro web framework for Python based on Werkzeug and Jinja2. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, providing the essentials to get a web application up and running.

### Advantages:
- **Simplicity**: Minimalistic and easy to get started with.
- **Flexibility**: Highly customizable and extensible.
- **Lightweight**: Suitable for small to medium-sized applications.

## When to Use Each
- **FastAPI**: Best for building APIs quickly with high performance and automatic documentation.
- **Django**: Ideal for full-fledged web applications with a lot of built-in features.
- **Flask**: Great for small to medium-sized applications where simplicity and flexibility are key.

# Uvicorn and Pydantic

## Uvicorn
Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server implementation, using `uvloop` and `httptools`. It is designed to be used with ASGI frameworks like FastAPI.

### Features:
- **Performance**: High-performance server.
- **Compatibility**: Supports HTTP/2 and WebSockets.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple to set up and run.

## Pydantic
Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library for Python, using Python type annotations. It is used by FastAPI for data validation and serialization.

### Features:
- **Data Validation**: Automatic validation of data based on type hints.
- **Serialization**: Easy conversion between Python objects and JSON.
- **Settings Management**: Simplifies configuration management.

# Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control). It allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to a class through different ways.

### In FastAPI:
- **Automatic Injection**: FastAPI automatically handles the injection of dependencies.
- **Type Hints**: Uses Python type hints to define dependencies.
- **Reusability**: Promotes reusability and modularity of code.
